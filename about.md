The project of [5loaves2fish was born in Italy](http://5p2p.it), where it is followed by thousands of young people every month. With the help of some people living in the US, we have recently started translating the blog in English, with the hope it can be helpful to you too.
Our wish is that this project can help you get deeper into an authentic encounter with the Lord, and to be fruitful in your life! There is a lot of material so give yourself time with it.

We have been organizing several workshops and retreats. They have all been in Europe so far, but we are getting ready to have the first edition in the US! If you want to know the latest news, [subscribe to the newsletter]({{site.baseurl}}/subscribe) below.
