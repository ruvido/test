One thing I'm very proud of is to be able to understand and speak different languages, even if I haven’t succeeded in understanding the male language yet (but I'm sure I'll make it sooner or later!). We have been living around Europe for already six years: first in Switzerland, then in France and now in Germany. A few days ago, while I was walking in Paris, I overheard a conversation between two lovers in a rocky relationship.. Every third word, she was repeating this sentence: " Tu n’est pas plus comme avant!", "Tu n'étais pas comme ça avant!" (...You are not who you used to be, you weren’t like this before). Hearing her words I realized two things: first, we women are all alike, from Paris to Palermo, from New York to Freiburg; second, I think I could start writing an encyclopedia universally accepted to be titled "The female universe, to make no mistake always play the shopping card", of at least a million pages only in the first volume.

Although Italian women are more demanding, French are more formal and German are more strapping (they manage to put a beer crate in the car with one hand while holding the baby with the other one), all the women I know are very good idealizers. How much we love to project on the other what we would like to HAVE! We want. We want perfection. If some poor man who approaches us is barely polite, we go home picturing him while preparing a delicious dinner for us with lots of candles and willing to change diapers, while we lie in the garden sniffing the bouquet of thirty red roses he has just given us. We are serious in this stuff: we are all professional movie directors. Not to mention if this poor guy lives by himself. What a charm! He indeed knows how to get by! He will never expect me to do things at home because he is used to do them; he deals with everything very well and understands that the issue concerns both of us (warning girls! My husband used to live by himself too, but he is allergic to housework). In short, we women all speak the same language: we always idealize the man in front of us, always demanding more from those unfortunates who approach us.

An obvious question arises: couldn’t it be that he has always been like that, while we have disguised him as a perfect man, without ever seeing him for whom he was? In the early days of a relationship we all think that we are dealing with an angel came down from Heaven, who will meet all of our expectations. Then, when the falling-in-love period ends (which is after at most a couple of years), one has to face the fact that he is a sinner, who, after all, is just like you. Suddenly defects appear, expectations are disappointed, and you realize he even has ugly hair on his right ear and loves to wear socks with sandals — the most anti-sexy thing you can see.

A friend of mine always says that disappointment is always the result of an **illusion**.

This is the time of Love as a choice, because true Love is a choice, not just butterflies in the stomach. Love can start from an attraction, a strong esteem or some complicity, but above all it is a choice. Look around. Think of a mother (ME) who gets up at 3 am to feed the baby and change diapers. Do you think that Love has anything to do with butterflies? The answer is NO, I would like to sleep and not be bothered at least at night. Or, does a wife who prepares dinner for her husband after a bad day spent with three brats have any butterflies in her stomach? The answer is still NO. Do you think it was out of a romantic feeling that Christ died on the cross for you?
But then...is Love a duty without feelings?

Love is a choice.

I didn’t choose this man because he fits my requirements, and not even because he will make me happy. I choose him because **I want to make him happy**, I Love him and I think it's worth spending my life with him (... even though we should talk again about the socks with sandals). St Francis is right: it is by giving that we receive. It is by spending your life for someone that you feel fulfilled. The butterflies in the stomach are a stage, beautiful and important, but if love fails to become a choice, if you don’t get your hands dirty, it is shallow and usually ends up with a nice blow.

My husband isn’t who he used to be, he is much **better** to my eyes since I decided to see him for whom he is. To see him and not my illusions.
