_Look up in the [Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}\glossary) to see what the Franciscan March is._

**Francesco** – I’ve got a very clear memory of the night before we started walking. We were seated next to a crumbling wall, surrounded by nature, admiring a magnificent sunset at the end of July. There the friar told us: "Don’t waste this opportunity: walk for something, walk to Assisi asking something to the Lord, something concrete." Why was I there? I had just started the spiritual journey with Fr. Massimo, and after so much listening I needed to do something practical. Also, I like to put miles under my feet, so the pilgrimage was perfect. After all, if you are not able to soften your heart, the fatigue, the heat and the sore feet will do it for you ... so in front of that sunset I asked the Lord to heal my relationships situation. This is why I was walking: in order to be healed from my disastrous love stories, the emotional failures and all those relationships that had never entirely closed (let’s remain friends?) ... I was there for this, now I knew.

**Alessandra** - Getting to the March was an endeavor. I was 16 and I was coming from a remote village in Basilicata, where sheep plus inhabitants don’t even get to eight thousand. I definitively wasn’t able to take a train by myself. I went there with my friend Giusy, who was older than me, and – most important - more experienced. The problem was that two days before the departure, Giusy didn’t feel like going anymore, but eventually, for my insistence, we ventured. My first memory of the March is the initial stage: 25 miles! Because of some accident we made two steps in one. Such an unspeakable enterprise for my legs, but especially for my "I am strong, I don’t leave my backpack, I take it, I'm not like the others, I can make it to the end" ... and then first I left my backpack, and then humiliated I got on that dying-people-collector truck for the last miles.

**Francesco** - The first stop was devastating. Almost 25 miles. Heat, sweat, thirst. We arrived shredded at the destination, in groups of one or two people. At the arrival there were some bowls of fresh water waiting for us to regenerate our destroyed feet. And each one’s arrival was also a surprise for all of us. It's amazing how sharing arises among people who have gone through the same "suffering." It happens the same in fatigue sports, such as cycling and athletics. It was the same feeling: we made it, with our legs, with our sweat, with no shortcut, no recommendation. When defensive barriers are so low and masks of the everyday life fell on the street, talking and getting to know people is so easy! Fr. Massimo had "forbidden" me to start a new relationship before I had healed my wounds (and, in particular, before I had closed a situation on which my mind and my heart were still focused). I used to say to myself that I was in a period of "reclaiming". But for this reason, having no expectations, it was natural to me to go to meet all (all) the girls in the March ... On the evening of the first day, there was a small group of girls seated on the ground enjoying the well earned rest. Boldly I went there to know them:

- What's your name?
- Alessandra

(ok stored)

- Where are you from?
- Basilicata

(uhmmmm, it’s so far in the south of Italy)

- How old are you?
- Sixteen, I just finished the third year of high school

(pffrrr ... cof cof)

Ok let's move on, I told myself.

**Alessandra** – During the walk, every now and then a guy appeared, a nice guy by the way. One day he said to me: "Hi Alessandra, I was looking for you, I wanted to walk a bit with you!".  And I – who was in the "Santa Maria Goretti" phase -replied: "Um, ah, well....", and I thought "Hey what the hell was his name? He calls me by name, maybe we talked before, but I don’t remember, so then who is he?". But as the days passed, Francesco appeared more and more. The weird thing was that usually nobody used to flirt with my in my hometown, so I had become the "fun" one. But with him it was different: I didn’t have time or energy to be someone, so I was myself, all the way myself. The thing that helped me staying so calm was that it was clear to me that we were too different: Francesco was eight years older than me - which at sixteen years old makes a big difference; he graduated in physics (!!!!) and was doing his PhD (I ignored the meaning and existence of that word) in Zurich, and he was used to speak English with people. I, a random silly girl, was in the third year of high school, I lived in the village next to the one where Carlo Levi was confined, surrounded by goats, and I felt sophisticated when I spoke Italian instead of dialect. I was very surprised by the way Francesco saw things. When I talked with him I felt like I could catch some fresh air of freedom. He said: "You can enroll in a faculty that you think you might like. You commit yourself to it and you take your exams, and then after one year you stop and see if it really is what you want to do. If not, you can change faculty, what's the problem?".

**Francesco** - The days went by clear and serene. The silence of the morning, the daily rosary and the feet always full of dirt for the journey were giving me great peace. The destination was getting close: the [Porziuncola Church]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary) and the forgiveness of the Father. I don’t know if by chance or will, I spent much time with Alessandra. I enjoyed her simplicity and her purity -"I am the King’s most beautiful daughter"- , they were oxygen for me. They purified me from my boastful life, which was all focused in competing at work and in being the best and the smartest in everything. With Alessandra, instead, it was enough to be myself. It was enough to walk and talk. So, without realizing it, we reached the destination. The friar said:

"Now you can kiss the ground"


and we entered the Porziuncola. I shudder as I remember these moments. We entered together, side by side. We were in front of the Father. Many had tears of emotion, tears of joy. We made it, we did our run and we won: we kept faith as St. Paul says. And there the Father's forgiveness was waiting for us, that forgiveness that He always wants to give, but that we so rarely ask. We were entering into the history, becoming a bit part of those old stones, which were there with St. Francis and his madness of love for Jesus.

**Alessandra** - After the March I had planned to go to visit my sister in Rome, in order to take a few days of vacation. But when Francesco invited me to go with him I said "Well, I don’t know...". The embarrassment was up, so I called my sister from a pay phone to tell her that I wouldn’t have gone:

- Mary, look I won’t ...
- Thank goodness you called! I have a problem at work: a girl left, so I absolutely need you to work with me tomorrow, thank goodness!
- No, actually I'm calling you because ...
- You saved me! Thank goodness, I didn’t know what to do
- Mary, look, I ...

the cash ran out, the call disconnected and I couldn’t talk to my sister. Eventually, under a summer downpour, Francesco and I arrived at the Assisi station, and we left to Rome. Three unforgettable days. In the morning I worked with my sister and from lunch onwards Francesco showed me around Rome. We walked a lot. We prayed the rosary in every church we met on the Capitoline, or in St. Paul. It was a really nice, deep and pure friendship.

**Francesco** - After the March, it was time to go back to the ordinary. But how was it possible after living such a moment of grace! Don’t ask me why, but I asked Ale to spend a few days in Rome with me. I wanted to show her my city, not as a tourist but as a Roman. There was no malice, no ulterior motives (for me the difference in age, but above all the different situations we were in: she in high school, me in Switzerland, were insurmountable). She was staying at her sister’s, and I took her around Rome with my bike for three days (true scenes from "Roman Holiday"). Three wonderful days.

In the following months, Alessandra sent me a picture of S. Pietro from the Pincio, taken in those days. I spent so much time looking at that picture again and again. Maybe, in the bottom of my heart, ... I had already guessed I had met the [woman of my life]({{site.baseurl}}\is-she-the-woman-of-my-life).

The Lord listened to me. Not only He healed my wounds, but He made sure that Alessandra and I could meet many times in Assisi that year, just for an inexplicable series of God-incidences, which would have led us to start dating one year later.
