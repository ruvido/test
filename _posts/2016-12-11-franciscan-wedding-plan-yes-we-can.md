I heard this sentence a thousand times: "We can’t get married because we’ve got no money", where by **money**, it's meant that for the reception. So: first there is the dress, the restaurant, the flowers, the car, the historic church, the photographer, the entertainment, the honeymoon, etc. Then we should please her mum who couldn’t afford much in her days and now wants her daughter's wedding to be the best one. And don’t forget her family is very large and they are a close family. So, just considering the most intimate ones, they are 150. And what about the little cousins, uncles, aunties, relatives here and relatives there, until the fifth generation on the mom’s side? Well it’s not nice not inviting them, they have been important for me... I absolutely have to find the aunt’s phone number... what was her name??

In short: **planning a wedding is a huge stress and, if you think of it this way, it is only affordable to a few Sheikh oil kings.** But then, let me say, those poor souls that will have to come to this wedding and sit at the tables —which have already been planned by the groom on a night when he was finally free because he fought with his future bride for the color of the wedding announcement— how much will they have to spend for you? In fact at a wedding like this you need to be well dressed, and you can’t wear the dress that you recycled from your sister's wedding: people can see it in the pictures and it’s embarrassing! And don’t forget the present! Oh gosh, the present! How much are these guys spending for us? At least 60$ per person for a piece of raw lasagna and a dessert that gives stomachache... damn, this means you're forced to give 100$ each (at least!). Well, there are five of us, what can we do? I can foresee the vacation at the beach house skipping for a wedding, noooo!!! I know it: Chiara will certainly have a fever (even if it’s June), yes: a sudden illness because her grandparents took her to the mountains where there was a bad weather. We can’t give up the beach house for _that_ wedding.

**Let's start over!** Let's start all over from the beginning. So, first of all, why are we getting married? Who has to absolutely be there that day? Who are we organizing this party for? **Marriage is primarily a vocation**, a call to love and joy. It will surely be the best day of our lives, even without a mortgage to set it up (it will be the best day for the _promise_ it brings, not for the _emotions_ of the moment). It may have a better start with the rent paid for three months, instead of 15 minutes of fireworks. The main host, if we can call it so, will be the Lord. If He won’t be there everything will simply gets harder and harder. Then, let’s retrace the passages of the Gospel that have marked our history. A week before the big yes, let’s go on a nice retreat, just the two of us, in some hermitage to pray, to fully enter into the mystery of the sacrament we are about to receive. Perhaps during the celebration we can tell the story of providence and beauty that we experienced, so that everyone can be grateful to the Lord and help us to thank Him.

And the organization? The lunch, the music, the dances ... the party is for guests, but for sure we are the celebrated ones; so we ourselves need to have fun first. Following the standards perhaps doesn’t always reflect our personalities.

Let's get into practice.

## How to organize a beautiful wedding

**The announcement:** we took an A4 sheet and we used the printer at home, which works fine. We divided it into four parts. On the first side there was the invitation to the ceremony and the reception with a clear indication for the gift: "The Lord loves the cheerful giver. As a gift we would like a lot of money. Give what you can —and then Fr. Giovanni Marini forced us to add —and **more than you can**. This money will be donated to an orphanage in Mozambique". Below that there was a small map that showed how to reach the church and the reception place, and on the back we gave details about the mission in Mozambique. Alternatively, one can even use the invitations themselves to support those in need. For example, [we support the projects of Sant'Antonio church in Milan.](http://creativelab.5p2p.it/)

**The dress:** on the Internet you can find really cheap stuff. I was lucky to have a mother who took on the role of dressmaker on the occasion, and so I just spent about 300$ for the fabric.

**Flowers:** never say they are for a wedding, they’ll fleece you! Five days before the wedding, I went with my sister’s friend to buy 150 gerberas —my favorite flower— and she told the florist they were for a super-Franciscan wedding, meaning that he could not ask for more than 150$, and indeed it was so. At the wedding of a friend of mine, I've decorated the church myself: two or three compositions here and there, and a flower on each bench, tied with a ribbon.

**Photographer:** if you rely on a professional, in most cases you will end up with someone who ignores the deep meaning of that day. Lacking the necessary sensitivity, he will pretend to direct the day without really understanding your needs. Here are two solutions: the first is to give the role to a friend who has passion for photography and the necessary equipment. The second option is to call [5loaves2fish](http://weddings.5p2p.it) (yes! we also do that). In fact, the posts you are reading, the videos and our witnessing are completely funded by our wedding photography activity.

**Location:** location??? What? 5,000$? What? A parish hall is always easy to find, perhaps with a nice garden (which you’ll really enjoy, if it doesn’t rain —as it happened at our wedding— or you can do it at the country house of a cousin who lives out of town (in France they have this habit).

**Lunch:** if the parish hall has a kitchen, you just have to add some scout friend who knows how to get by in any situation, or some volunteer who doesn’t want to give up the beach house to make you a gift; otherwise caterer, nice paper plates, plastic steam glasses and a bit of creativity. My father, for example, brought wine, my grandmother cheese, we bought some cold cuts from a farm, a friend made the cake, the caterer prepared a lasagna and the second course with a side (900€, waiters included, for 80 people).


**The entertainer:** a friend who plays the piano bar, a good stereo, etc. Tarantella dance never goes out of fashion...

**The wedding-mobile:** as for the car, your cheap car works fine; polished as it was new, with hitched cans hung on the back, it looks cool ;-)

In conclusion, for our wedding we spent about 2,000$, including the offer for the church and the 10 nights we spent in the adjoining guesthouse. **The most important thing is to put the most important things first**, and everything else around them. The most important thing is not to be sucked into this chasm of organization, and then look up. At our wedding many guests were in jeans, but we really enjoyed ourselves. The most beautiful gifts were the envelopes full of small change from my college friends, who really gave up a pizza for it and they did it from the heart.

Yes you can, what do you say?
