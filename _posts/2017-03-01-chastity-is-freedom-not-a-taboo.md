summary: When they told me, right after my conversion, that the Church was against
  premarital sex I was skeptical. Like many, I thought people in the Church really
  needed an update. The year was 2001.

At that time I was dating a girl and for several months an idea had been whirring in my head. I sensed that the relationship between a man and a woman came about through many means of communication. Imagine the two of you as two lakes connected by several channels, with water passing from one basin to the other: there is the channel of talking, the channel of sharing, the channel of discussing... and there's the channel of sex. I knew the latter was by far the one with the largest flow rate. And what happens when a communication branch is way larger than the others? All the water goes through that one channel and all the other smaller streams almost run dry.


## What does it mean in practice?

It means that in many occasions sex takes the place of other ways of communication, such as talking to each other after a quarrel, being tender, making plans together. Following this intuition, I tried to restrain the sex channel in order to make sure that water went in all directions. The result was a partial failure. But I learned the reason why only later on.


## Making love with a person is belonging

Sex entails our whole being, our body, and our feelings. It is a **total** experience. It is the complete gift of yourself but also it is the full **reception** of the other. Think carefully whether it is not so! Sex establishes a very strong bond between two people. A beautiful bond. But at the same time, this bond introduces a constraint, a belonging to the other. This explains the pain and the suffering when two lovers break up! When I broke up with a girlfriend I was always left with a sense of **betrayal** in my heart; a sense that I was betraying the other who had given herself completely to me. And I’m telling this from a merely **human** point of view. I am certainly not referring to the Genesis here _...a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body_. My attempt in restraining the sex channel was a failure because the other person felt rejected as if I was denying her the gift of myself.

## Chastity

On the other hand, the announcement I heard in[Assisi]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary) and at the [10 Commandments course]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary) entailed a great freedom. When two people decide to start dating, they embark on a journey of discovery and discernment for them to commit to each other forever.

When two people are dating, everything is usually taken too much for granted.

The couple is only **on a trial**. Hence, everyone has the right to feel absolutely **free** to withdraw from the relationship ‘til the day of the wedding. Chastity is one of the fundamental tools to live this freedom to the fullest. Is it hard and painful? Sure, it can be sometimes, so what?

Chastity requires courage.

Chastity is unconventional.

And where is courage, there are adventure and passion. Someone  who decides to have intercourse is not the real nonconformist! That is the easy way. Chastity instead offers you **a reckless and lively life**. Try it, and you will see how all the other channels of your relationship will be magnified, as the water of love cleanses and rehabilitates all the streams. You will see how you’ll be able to face each other in freedom, with no undercover or unspoken ties.

Finally, I want you to ponder one thing. The sexual act is not only a unifying act but also a creative act. Every time you make love with your girlfriend a child can be born. And don’t talk to me about safe sex... I know it well too. The truth is that we can all make mistakes and that condoms do break. This is my personal experience. Maybe you think it is very unlikely, that the probability is one over a hundred or a thousand. Think about this: would you cross the street if they told you that once every hundred times you cross, you are run over and you die?

I know several people who believe that sexual intercourse is not a palliative and other people who think it is important to have sex before marriage to be sure you have chosen the right person. Based on my experience I say that it doesn’t actually work this way.

... and you? Are you still so sure?
